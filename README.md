# Deepred-Mt: Deep Representation Learning for Predicting C-to-U RNA Editing in Plant Mitochondria

Deepred-Mt is a novel method for predicting RNA editing in plant mitochondria
using deep neural networks.

This repository contains scripts that were used to build and train Deepred-Mt,
along with other utilities.

# Dependencies

The code was developed and tested using python 3.7.4 and TensorFlow 2.3.0
